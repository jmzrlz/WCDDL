WCDDL

The de facto DDL script developed to replace previous, outdated and vulnerable scripts.

The latest version of WCDDL requires the following:
- >= PHP 5.3
- MySQL
- PDO (PHP, included by default)

To install:
- Upload the modules folder and all PHP files
- Import database.sql into your database
- Edit wcfg.php to contain valid settings
- Test it!
